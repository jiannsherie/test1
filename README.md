Git - version control
GitHub - online code storage
Best way to take a team task without conflicts.

Streamlines files and naming conventions through commits in a repository. 

Virtual snapshots of an entire project along the timeline. 

Your most recent commit is labeled “HEAD” a digital “You are here” stamp.

Useful to ensure zero loss of code while you work on a branch to perfect your functionality. This branch function in GitHub actually keeps your code separate while collaborating in a team workspace, until you are ready to merge avoiding conflicts.

Repository - git focused file tracker. 1 project is a repository. The amount of repositories vary based on project size. 

A repository can be housed locally to your machine via a clone.

Working in terminal creative a project folder via mkdir projects, then cd projects.  Following that, enter git clone and paste the copied link form GitHub.
